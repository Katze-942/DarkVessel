# Hi, my name is Zhora üëã

I am a student, my main language of communication is Russian. My first programming language was JavaScript on Node.js. Now I'm learning HTML5 and PHP in parallel, i.e. I'm getting deeper into web development. My knowledge stack is small at the moment, but I spend more time on practice than theory.

## Brief background

From 2019 to 2021 I was doing programming as a hobby, writing bots in Node.js for Discord and Telegram. As an IDE, I prefer VS Code. Since 2022 I started to devote myself more to this business and now started —Ñ HTML5 and creating website layouts in Figma and Lunacy.

## What's your knowledge stack?

My knowledge stack can be described like this:

- Node.js (discord.js, grammY, express, sequelize)
- HTML5, SCSS, TypeScript and PHP
- MySQL/MariaDB (database)
- Gulp and Docker for automation
- Bash, Python for scripts
- ESLint, Stylelint, HTMLHint for code styling
- Figma, Lunacy and Adobe Illustrator for creating website layouts.

Of the distributions, I prefer EndeavourOS and macOS.
I am planning to learn C# and React in the near future.
