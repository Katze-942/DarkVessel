# Hi! This is my config for oh-my-zsh. Oh-my-zsh and plugins are automatically downloaded and installed.
# Let me know if there are any problems.
# Permission is granted to copy and modify this config in peace.
#
# After installing oh-my-zsh, please type "exit" or press Ctrl + D to continue the installation process.
#
# Please note: the autocomplete for your batch manager will not work unless you activate the right plugin for it.
# For example to activate the autocomplete command "pacman" you need to enable the plugin "archlinux"
#
# It requires git and curl/wget installed on the system.
# Note also that an alias for the cat command is set in the config.

# Enjoy your use!
