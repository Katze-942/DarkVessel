## Hello everyone, I'm Zhora üëã

I study Node.js in conjunction with TypeScript and basically write Telegram and Discord bots, but I don't mind learning anything else. Recently, I began to study frontend, namely HTML and CSS. True, at the moment I am suffering from a lack of time due to school, and so far there are no projects that I could be proud of for real, but I am sure that in the future they will appear.

### Skills that I own
I know almost all the basics of JavaScript (though not browser) and have been writing on the Node.js platform since about 2020. At the beginning of this year, I also began using the TypeScript compiler with ESLint. In addition, I actively learn these things:
- MySQL/MariaDB (SQL)
- HTML/CSS
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Python
- bash

In addition, I try to use various useful tools like Stylelint and others.
### How to contact me and where I am at all?
I communicate in different messenger and social networks. Here are the main ones:
 - Telegram: https://t.me/katze_942
 - Mastodon (blog, rarely writing something): https://social.linux.pizza/@katze
 - Discord: `–ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ç-–ñ–æ—Ä—Ä–∞ 942#2008` (ID: `517331770656686080`)
 - Matrix: https://matrix.to/#/@katze-942:matrix.org
 - Mail: rs5334819@gmail.com

### I have something else to say
I also eat on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Katze_942/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChoAy5_itTHfsngdbRFhR)! For any questions you can write to me in personal messages, I think that's all, I have nothing special to write. Good evening, morning or night to you.
