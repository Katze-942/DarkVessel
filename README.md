# Hello everyone, I'm Zhora ðŸ‘‹

I'm learning Node.js in combination with TypeScript and I mostly write bots for Telegram and Discord, but I don't mind learning something else. I recently started learning HTML5. Right now I'm suffering from lack of time because of my studies :(

## Some of my skills

I know TypeScript well and have been programming in Node.js since about 2020. I try to write cleanly and by standards, using ESLint, Stylelint and other stuff, even if it doesn't always work out. Here's a short list of things I have knowledge of:

- HTML/CSS
- TypeScript
- MySQL/MariaDB (SQL)
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Python
- Bash.

I also plan to study C# and React.

## How to contact me and where I am at all?

I communicate in different messenger and social networks. Here are the main ones:

- Telegram: <https://t.me/katze_942>
- Mastodon (my dumb blog): <https://lor.sh/@Katze_942>
- Discord: `@katze_942` (ID: `517331770656686080`)
- Matrix: <https://matrix.to/#/@katze-942:matrix.org>
- Mail: <rs5334819@gmail.com>

## I have something else to say

I am also registered at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Katze_942/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChoAy5_itTHfsngdbRFhR) (sometimes posting all kinds of timelapses). Thank you for your attention!
